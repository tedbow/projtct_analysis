<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>

Hello project maintainers,

This is an automated issue to help make this module compatible with Drupal 10.

To read more about this effort by the Drupal Association, please read: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/blog/the-project-update-bot-is-being-refreshed-to-support-drupal-10-readiness-of-contributed-projects">The project update bot is being refreshed to support Drupal 10 readiness of contributed projects</a>

Periodically patches will be added to this issue that remove Drupal 10 deprecated API uses. To stop further patches from being posted simply close this issue (any status <strong>besides</strong> Active, Needs review or Needs work) or remove the "{{ auto_tag }}" tag from the issue.

The patches will be posted by the <a href="/u/project-update-bot">Project Update Bot</a> official user account. This account will not receive any issue credit contributions for itself or any company.

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>

You have a few options for how to use this issue:

<ol>
<li><strong>Accept automated patches until this issue is closed</strong>

If this issue is left open (status of Active, Needs review or Needs work) and the "{{ auto_tag }}" tag is left on this issue, new patches will be posted periodically if new deprecation fixes are needed.

As the Drupal Rector project improves and is able to fix more deprecated API uses, the patches posted here will cover more of the deprecated API uses in the module.
</li>

<li><strong>Leave open but stop new automated patches.</strong>

If you want to use this issue as a starting point to remove deprecated API uses but don't want new automated patches simply leave this issue open but remove the "{{ auto_tag }}" tag from the issue.

You can use <a href="https://github.com/palantirnet/drupal-rector">Drupal Rector</a> yourself to make these patches.

If you want to receive automated patches again, add back the "{{ auto_tag }}" tag.
</li>

<li><strong>Close it and don't use it</strong>

If the maintainers of this project don't find this issue useful, they can close this issue (any status <strong>besides</strong> Active, Needs review or Needs work) and no more automated patches will be posted here.

If the issue is reopened, then new automated patches will be posted.

If you are using another issue(s) to work on Drupal 10 compatibility it may be useful to other contributors to add those issues as "Related issues" when closing this issue.</li>
</ol>
